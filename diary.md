# Qs
- How to bundle .html files with js target?
    - supply them in /dist?
        - sucks that /dist isnt delete-able
        - sucks for vcs

# Recipes
- `haxe compile.hxml` is (probably?) how vscode is compiling everything

# Whining
- Linux support kinda sucks for Hashlink? Latest release with a linux binary was 2018 lol
